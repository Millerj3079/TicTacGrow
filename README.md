# Tic Tac Grow

Tic Tac Grow is an expanded version of the classic Tic Tac Toe game. The game starts with a 3x3 grid, and whenever a player achieves 3 in a row, the board expands outward by one square. The objective is to be the first to achieve 5 points, with subsequent steps requiring increasingly larger winning streaks (5 in a row, 7 in a row, etc.).

## Gameplay

1. **Starting the Game**: The game begins on a 3x3 grid.
2. **Scoring**: When a player makes 3 in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally), they earn 1 point, and the board expands by one square in each direction.
3. **Continuing Play**: After 3 in a row, the next goal is to achieve 5 in a row, then 7 in a row, and so on, each time earning an additional point.
4. **Winning**: The first player to reach 5 points wins the game.

## How to Play

- **Step 1**: Choose a player to go first (X or O).
- **Step 2**: Click on an empty cell to place your mark.
- **Step 3**: After a player gets 3 in a row, the board will automatically expand.
- **Step 4**: The game continues with increasing goals (5 in a row, 7 in a row, etc.) until one player reaches 5 points.
