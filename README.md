# Tic Tac Grow

Tic Tac Grow is an expanded version of the classic Tic Tac Toe game, now supporting up to 9 players. The game starts with a 3x3 grid, and whenever a player achieves 3 in a row, the board expands outward by one square. Players earn points by achieving streaks (3 in a row, 5 in a row, etc.), and the first player to reach 5 points wins.

## Gameplay

1. **Starting the Game**:
    - The game begins on a 3x3 grid.
    - Players are identified by numbers (1-9), with each player assigned a unique color.
    - Upon load or reset, the game prompts for the number of players.

2. **Scoring**:
    - Players earn 1 point for completing a streak (3 in a row, 5 in a row, etc.).
    - After achieving a streak, the player continues to build upon their success, with the next goal increasing to the next odd number (e.g., from 3 to 5).

3. **Continuing Play**:
    - Players take turns placing their marks on the board.
    - When a player completes a streak, the board expands outward, and the streak's cells are marked with the playerâ€™s color.
    - Players can continue to build on prior successes, using previously successful streaks in subsequent turns.

4. **Winning**:
    - The first player to reach 5 points wins the game.

## How to Play

- **Step 1**: Start the game by entering the number of players (1-9) when prompted.
- **Step 2**: Players take turns placing their marks on the board by clicking an empty cell.
- **Step 3**: After achieving a streak (e.g., 3 in a row), the player earns a point, and the board expands.
- **Step 4**: The game continues with the next streak target (e.g., 5 in a row) until one player reaches 5 points.

## Visual Aids

- **Player Colors**: Each player is assigned a unique color, which is used to mark cells involved in completed streaks.
- **Board Expansion**: After each successful streak, the board expands outward to accommodate the growing challenge.
- **Streak Tracking**: The current streak target and points for each player are displayed, helping players keep track of their progress.
